# TASK-3-GENDER_AGE_DETECTION

This project utilizes deep learning models to detect faces in an image and predict the age and gender of each detected face. The implementation is done using OpenCV and pre-trained models for face detection, age prediction, and gender prediction. Overview: The goal of this project is to accurately detect faces in an image and predict the age and gender of the detected faces using pre-trained deep learning models. The models are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and are trained on large datasets to perform these predictions. Features: Face detection using a pre-trained face detection model. Age prediction using a pre-trained age prediction model. Gender prediction using a pre-trained gender prediction model. Visualization of detected faces with predicted age and gender labels.
